## CollabCanvas

A collaborative drawing app you can use to get creative with your friends.

#### To get it working on your local machine:

1. `brew tap mongodb/brew`
2. `brew update` if needed
3. `brew install mongodb-community`
4. If prompted `xcode-select â€“install`
5. and 6.	` brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community`, but only this one time. That's not neccesary to continually do. 
6. `npm install ws`
7. `node server.js`
8. Visit http://localhost:9999/
9. http://localhost:9999/login.html
&

The project is still in beta stages.
